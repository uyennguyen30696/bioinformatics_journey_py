This is a documentation of my beginning practice in learning Python for bioinformatics. Each file contains solutions for bioinformatics problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info)

I run my code on [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html), or [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Code Runner Extension (compatible with multiple programming languages).

Smaller steps count toward bigger goal!
