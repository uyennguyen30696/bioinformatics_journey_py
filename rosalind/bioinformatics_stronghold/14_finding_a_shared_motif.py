# A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".
# Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

# Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.
# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)

# Problem breakdown
# Common substring not to be confused with common subsequence. Common substring is continuous while common subsequence is not necessary continuous, but the order of each element is maintained
# Sort the array of all dna sequences to get the shortest string, and store the rest in the remain_strs array
# The longest common substring can not be longer than the shortest string, that's why we only need to test the shortest string and its substrings compared to all other strings
# To find the collection of substrings from the shortest string, we first test the substring with length l, then the 2 substrings length l - 1, and so forth
# Since the collection of substrings we found this way ranges from longest to shorest length, the first common substring we find will automatically be the answer, the longest common substring
